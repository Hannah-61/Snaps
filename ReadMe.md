# Snaps - Sprint 2

Welcome to **Snaps Sprint 2**! ðŸš€ I've diving deeper into the project to make it more interactive, visually appealing, and user-friendly. My focus is to enhance functionality, improve user experience, and ensure smooth navigation through the application.

## Project Overview

In Sprint 1, I built the foundation of the Snaps application. Now, in Sprint 2:

1. **Expand the Home Page** - Used Provided Api to gather photo metadata and implemented a click on the photos to direct it to the photo details page.
2. **Introduce a Photo Details Page** - Allow users to view detailed information about selected photos, including existing comments and post new comment.

The aim is to create an engaging platform where users can browse, interact with, and discuss their favorite photos seamlessly.

## Expected Outcomes

* A fully functional React application with multi-page routing.
* Dynamic data fetching and rendering using a mock API.
* A responsive UI that adapts beautifully across devices.
* Practical experience with React, SASS, and API integration.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
* npm (bundled with Node.js)
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) (to test the API)

## Core Functionalities

* **Routing:** Use `<span>react-router-dom</span>` for seamless multi-page navigation.
* **Data Handling:** Fetch and display photos dynamically with Axios.
* **Navigation:** Ensure the logo redirects to the home page.
* **Commenting Feature:** Allow users to add comments and retain them on page refresh.
* **Responsive Layout:** Guarantee a consistent experience across all devices.

## Working with the API

* API Endpoint: [Backend API](https://unit-3-project-c5faaab51857.herokuapp.com/)
* Refer to the API documentation for authentication and data access.

## Design Considerations

* Adhere to the provided design mockups for a cohesive look.
* Utilize **SASS variables** to maintain design consistency.
* Apply the **BEM naming convention** to keep styles modular and reusable.
* Leverage **Flexbox** for effective layout management.

## Useful Tools & Resources

* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for navigation.
* [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for handling API requests.
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling.
